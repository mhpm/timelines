## MICHELLE PEREZ MORALES: TIMELINES PROJECT

- How long you spent on the assignment: 3 days
- What you like about your implementation: Clean, readable code, the way how I render the timelines(I enjoyed the challenge)
- What you would change if you were going to do it again: Maybe I will try doing this using <canva> for a better performance.
- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that: Nope, This is my own design. It is not the best but I tried =)
- How you would test this if you had more time: probably comparing the order how events array was created.
